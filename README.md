# DevOps Intern Assignment - Powerplay

This repository contains my completed **DevOps Internship Assessment** for **Powerplay**.  
The project demonstrates my practical understanding of **Linux administration, AWS EC2 setup, automation scripting, and system monitoring**.

## Part 1: Environment Setup

**Objective:** Launch and configure an EC2 instance for DevOps tasks.

**Steps Followed:**
1. Created a new **AWS EC2 Instance** using **Amazon Linux 2** in the `eu-north-1 (Stockholm)` region.
2. Configured **security groups** to allow SSH (port 22) access.
3. Connected to the instance securely via **MobaXterm** using the `.pem` key.
4. Verified connectivity and system information using:
   ```bash
   hostnamectl
   whoami
   cat /etc/os-release

## üåê Part 3: Web Server Setup

### **Objective:**  
Deploy a simple HTML web page using Apache.

### **Steps:**
1. Installed Apache:
   ```bash
   sudo yum install httpd -y
   sudo systemctl start httpd
   sudo systemctl enable httpd
   2. Created a simple HTML page:
   ```html
   <h1>Welcome to Likhith‚Äôs DevOps Server!</h1>
   <p>This page is hosted on an EC2 instance for Powerplay Internship Assessment.</p>


3. Verified by accessing the EC2 Public IP in the browser.

## ‚ö° Part 4: Automation Script & Cron Job

### **Objective:**  
Automate system status logging using a bash script and cron.

### **Steps:**

1. Created a bash script `system_report.sh`
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   echo "System Report generated on: $(date)"
   echo "----------------------------------"
   echo "Hostname: $(hostname)"
   echo "Uptime:"
   uptime
   echo "Disk Usage:"
   df -h
  Made it executable:
  chmod +x system_report.sh
Scheduled it to run every 5 minutes:
crontab -e
   Added this line:
*/5 * * * * /home/ec2-user/system_report.sh >> /home/ec2-user/report.log 2>&1
4. Verified that the script executed automatically and logs were updated.
